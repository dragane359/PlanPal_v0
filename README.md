# PlanPal - Meetings Made Easy! 

PlanPal

The one-stop application to ease your scheduling worries!

Motivation

Amidst the hustle and bustle of your busy schedule, you thought about meeting your old friends after a while. Thinking that your friends will be busy, you decided to delay a meetup with your friends. You finally decided to contact them, but to your dismay, another year has passed, you find out that your friends are even busier with their schedule. 

Adulting is no easy task. Oftentimes, meeting up with friends and loved ones are delayed not because everyone is busy, but instead, parties are not coordinating their schedules properly.
This lack of coordination discourages meet-ups from happening. 

Coordinating schedules are often a hassle as work and study schedules are subject to change. Hence, a single place where individuals can view the schedules and work commitments of others is needed.

Aim

We hope to be able to provide users with a single place where they can view the schedules of their friends and families. Providing them a platform for them to come up with common timing to make events happen. Here, they will be able to join different groups to schedule and plan a meetup. Additional features are tailor-made to ensure that the entirety of the meeting up is hassle-free.
